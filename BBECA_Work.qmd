## Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

Protects a raised ombrotrophic peat bog in Delta, BC.

* 50+ years of peat harvesting & development
  * **BBECA** established in 2004
* Restoration practices include:
  * Ditch blocking
  * Seedling removal

## Climatology

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Mean air temperature is 10.5 C. Average annual precipitation and evapotranspiration are 1160 mm and 750 mm.
 
* Summer: droughts, heatwaves, & fires 
* Winter: flooding

## Comparing Management Strategies


Preliminary analysis: ditch blocking reduces radiative forcing.

* How would CLASSIC handle these two sites?

## GHG fluxes from Prairie Pothole wetlands 

In collaboration with Ducks Unlimited Canada, we are measuring GHG fluxes from wetlands in the Prairie Pothole region of Canada (Manitoba).

## GHG fluxes from Prairie Pothole wetlands 

Despite both looking like typical marshes, they have VERY different $CH_{4}$ fluxes driven by differences in sulfate between the sites. This could be an interesting case study for CLASSIC.
