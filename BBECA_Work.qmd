## Introduction

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Burns Bog is a raised ombrotrophic peatland in the Fraser River Delta. 

* **BBECA** created in 2005 
  * Promote peat growth, increase water retention, & minimize/reverse C loss
    * 50+ years of peat removal
  * Restoration practices include:
    * Ditch blocking & seedling removal

## Climatology

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

BBECA has a mean annual air temperature of 10 C and receives 1200 mm of precipitation a year.

* Mediterranean climate poses management challenges
  * Summer: heatwaves, droughts, & fires 
  * Winter: Intense precipitation & flooding

## BB1

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Beakrush-sphagnum ecosystem undergoing active restoration with an EC station established in 2015. 

* Harvested from 1957 to 1963
  * Rewetting (ditch-blocking) began in 2007
* Net-neutral C fluxes (2016 - 2021)
  * CO<sub>2</sub> uptake offset by CH<sub>4</sub> emissions
    * *Positive Radiative Balance*
  * Significant inter-annual variability

## BB2


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Beakrush-sphagnum/pine-sphagnum ecosystem with an EC station established in 2019. 

* Harvested from 1930 to 1948
  * Rewetting by passive means
* Net C source (2020)
  * Net CO<sub>2</sub> emission
  * Lower CH<sub>4</sub> emission than BB1

## BBS

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}


Pine-sphagnum ecosystem burned by wildfire in 2015.

* Post-fire pine seedling germination
  * 2006 fire > in dense pine stand > halted peat development
  * Seedling removal initiated in 2019
* Chamber experiment assessing impacts of removal on respiration
* Mobile flux tower will be installed in seedling area

# Proposed Research

## Modelling Fluxes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Metro Vancouver Sustainability and Innovation Fund.

* Modeling impacts of change on carbon and climate
  * Test influence of management scenarios
  * Optimize C sequestration of the BBECA
* Refine spatial inventory of BBECA Ecosystems
