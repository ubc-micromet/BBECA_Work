	abstract = {Peatland drainage depletes large carbon stocks by increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the soil. Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing CO2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased CO2 uptake, and enhanced methane (CH4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak CO2 sink (−26.1 ± 6.1 g C-CO2 m−2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near CO2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-CO2 m−2). Higher CH4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of CH4 can offset CO2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing (RF) modeling suggests sustained CO2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive RF over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger RF beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions.},

	abstract = {Area burned, number of fires, seasonal fire severity, and fire season length are all expected to increase in Canada, with largely unquantified ecosystem feedbacks. However, there are few observational studies measuring ecosystem-scale biogeochemical (e.g., carbon dioxide exchanges) and biophysical (e.g., energy partitioning) properties during smoke episodes and hence assessing responses of gross primary production (GPP) to changes in incoming diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In this study, we leveraged two long-term eddy covariance measurement sites in forest and wetland ecosystems to study four smoke episodes, which happened at different times and differed in length, over 4 different years (2015, 2017, 2018, and 2020). We found that the highest decrease in shortwave irradiance due to smoke was about 50 \% in July and August but increased to about 90 \% when the smoke arrived in September. When the smoke arrived in the later stage of summer, impacts on sensible and latent heat fluxes were very different than the earlier ones. Smoke generally increased the diffuse fraction (DF) from ∼ 0.30 to ∼ 0.50 and turned both sites into stronger carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks with increased GPP up to ∼ 18 \% and ∼ 7 \% at the forest and wetland site, respectively. However, when DF exceeded 0.80 as a result of dense smoke, both ecosystems became net CO2 sources as total PAR dropped to low values. The results suggest that this kind of natural experiment is important for validating future predictions of smoke–productivity feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Peatland ecosystems are generally carbon (C) sinks. However, the role of dissolved organic C (DOC) relative to gaseous fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in the C balance of these ecosystems has not often been studied. Dissolved C fluxes are important for understanding C partitioning within the peatland and the potential C drainage from it. This research was conducted in Burns Bog, a heavily impacted ecosystem near Vancouver, Canada, undergoing ecological restoration efforts by rewetting. Here we present data on (i) ecosystem-scale fluxes of CO2 (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) and CH4 (FCH4) determined by eddy covariance, (ii) evasion fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from the water surface to estimate the role of open water in ecosystem-scale fluxes, and (iii) DOC flux (fDOC) in water draining from the peatland. Our results showed that open water areas inside the footprint were a continual C source, emitting 47.0 ± 2.4 g C·m−2·year−1. DOC export (15.6 g C·m−2·year−1) was significant to the net ecosystem C balance, decreasing the magnitude of the eddy covariance-determined C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4) of −45.0 ± 16.8 g C·m−2·year−1 by 35\%, resulting in a net ecosystem C balance (i.e., NEE + FCH4 + fDOC) of −29.7 ± 17.0 g C·m−2·year−1. Most of this offset occurred during the wetter nongrowing season when gross primary production was low and fDOC was relatively high.},

	abstract = {Depth to water table is a simple, commonly used measure of hydrological function in raised bogs. The maximum depth of the water table or the average annual water table is often monitored over the long term to track the hydrological trajectory of the ecosystem. These measures, however, may not take into account the duration of the moisture deficit period. The annual water table moisture deficit (WTMD) at 67 sites in a single disturbed raised bog was calculated using the amount of time that the water table was at each depth below the surface during the moisture deficit season. The calculated value estimates a linearly developing deficit that dewaters the acrotelm during the moisture deficit season. At each site, plant species composition was assigned to one of eight plant community types. The approximate threshold above which bog plant communities will begin transitioning into drier types with taller shrubs and trees was a WTMD of 62 m-days. An annual climatic moisture deficit (CMD) was calculated using daily air temperature, spatially interpolated precipitation and estimated potential evapotranspiration for each site. Mixed-effects modelling of WTMD as a function CMD indicated a positive linear relation for most vegetation types, which was affected by the presence of drainage ditches, ditch blocking, fire and evapotranspiration by shrubs and trees. Tracking the WTMD and its relation to CMD may be useful for assessing ecosystem health and serve as a basis for estimating moisture deficit thresholds for bogs of conservation concern.},

	abstract = {Throughfall and stemflow observations were used to quantify interception loss from five vegetation communities with complex multi-layered vegetative structure over the course of a year in a maritime raised bog in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Separate plot-averaged interception loss estimates for trees and shrubs were computed from randomly relocated throughfall collectors and stemflow observations of trees. Independent throughfall observations from individual trees stratified by distance from the trunk were scaled to the plot extent based on tree configuration and canopy structure derived from LiDAR. Estimates from tree-based sampling compared favorably with plot-averaged tree throughfall means; however, results were biased towards underestimating throughfall compared to estimates from random observations possibly due to evaporation from the tree-based throughfall samplers, an issue that could be remedied using a different design. Nevertheless, this approach shows potential as a tool for estimating throughfall in forests with heterogeneous vegetation characteristics, and should be further tested and developed. Annual tree interception loss from birch was 15\% of gross precipitation and average throughfall ranged from 75\% to 83\% during the leafed and leafless seasons, respectively. Tree interception loss in three pine stands of varying height and density was 13, 15 and 9\% of gross precipitation. Stemflow from trees contributed between 0.4 and 3\% of net precipitation, and smaller trees generated stemflow more efficiently. Interception loss from shrub ranged from 20\% to 36\% of gross precipitation. Tree throughfall increased with distance from trunks whereas shrub throughfall showed an opposite trend, and the relationship varied between stands. This study demonstrates the importance of shrub vegetation when quantifying net precipitation in vegetation communities typical of peatlands.},
